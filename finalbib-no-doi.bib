	abstract = {Using a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, we investigate how the density probability distribution function (PDF) changes when including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and protostellar outflows and heating. We find that the density PDF is not lognormal when outflows and self-gravity are considered. Self-gravity produces a power-law tail at high densities, and the inclusion of stellar feedback from protostellar outflows and heating produces significant time-varying deviations from a lognormal distribution at low densities. The simulation with outflows has an excess of diffuse gas compared to the simulations without outflows, exhibits an increased average sonic Mach number, and maintains a slower star formation rate (SFR) over the entire duration of the run. We study the mass transfer between the diffuse gas in the lognormal peak of the PDF, the collapsing gas in the power-law tail, and the stars. We find that the mass fraction in the power-law tail is constant, such that the stars form out of the power-law gas at the same rate at which the gas from the lognormal part replenishes the power law. We find that turbulence does not provide significant support in the dense gas associated with the power-law tail. When including outflows and magnetic fields in addition to driven turbulence, the rate of mass transfer from the lognormal to the power law, and then to the stars, becomes significantly slower, resulting in slower SFRs and longer depletion times.},

	abstract = {Radiative feedback is an important consequence of cluster formation in giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in which newly formed clusters heat and ionize their surrounding gas. The process of cluster formation, and the role of radiative feedback, has not been fully explored in different GMC environments. We present a suite of simulations which explore how the initial gravitational boundedness, and radiative feedback, affect cluster formation. We model the early evolution ({\textless}5 Myr) of turbulent, 106 M⊙ clouds with virial parameters ranging from 0.5 to 5. To model cluster formation, we use cluster sink particles, coupled to a raytracing scheme, and a custom subgrid model which populates a cluster via sampling an initial mass function (IMF) with an efficiency of 20 per cent per free-fall time. We find that radiative feedback only decreases the cluster particle formation efficiency by a few per cent. The initial virial parameter plays a much stronger role in limiting cluster formation, with a spread of cluster formation efficiencies of 37-71 per cent for the most unbound to the most bound model. The total number of clusters increases while the maximum mass cluster decreases with an increasing initial virial parameter, resulting in steeper mass distributions. The star formation rates in our cluster particles are initially consistent with observations but rise to higher values at late times. This suggests that radiative feedback alone is not responsible for dispersing a GMC over the first 5 Myr of cluster formation.},

	abstract = {The clusters of young stars in massive star-forming regions show a wide range of sizes, morphologies, and numbers of stars. Their highly subclustered structures are revealed by the MYStIX project's sample of 31,754 young stars in nearby sites of star formation (regions at distances {\textless}3.6 kpc that contain at least one O-type star.) In 17 of the regions surveyed by MYStIX, we identify subclusters of young stars using finite mixture models—collections of isothermal ellipsoids that model individual subclusters. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the model parameters, and the Akaike Information Criterion is used to determine the number of subclusters. This procedure often successfully finds famous subclusters, such as the BN/KL complex behind the Orion Nebula Cluster and the KW-object complex in M 17. A catalog of 142 subclusters is presented, with 1-20 subclusters per region. The subcluster core radius distribution for this sample is peaked at 0.17 pc with a standard deviation of 0.43 dex, and subcluster core radius is negatively correlated with gas/dust absorption of the stars—a possible age effect. Based on the morphological arrangements of subclusters, we identify four classes of spatial structure: long chains of subclusters, clumpy structures, isolated clusters with a core-halo structure, and isolated clusters well fit by a single isothermal ellipsoid.},

We provide a range of values of the physical properties of molecular clouds, and find a power-law correlation between their radii and masses, suggesting that the fractal dimension of the interstellar medium is around 2.36. This relation, M = (228 ± 18) R 2.36 ± 0.04, allows us to derive masses for an additional 170 Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) molecular clouds not covered by the UMSB survey. We derive the Galactic surface mass density of molecular gas and examine its spatial variations throughout the Galaxy. We find that the azimuthally averaged Galactic surface density of molecular gas peaks between Galactocentric radii of 4 and 5 kpc. Although the Perseus arm is not detected in molecular gas, the Galactic surface density of molecular gas is enhanced along the positions of the Scutum-Crux and Sagittarius arms. This may indicate that molecular clouds form in spiral arms and are disrupted in the inter-arm space. Finally, we find that the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds decreases away from the Galactic center, suggesting a possible decline in the star formation rate with Galactocentric radius. There is a marginally significant enhancement in the CO excitation temperature of molecular clouds at a Galactocentric radius of about 6 kpc, which in the longitude range of the GRS corresponds to the Sagittarius arm. This temperature increase could be associated with massive star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm.},

	abstract = {While feedback from massive stars exploding as supernovae (SNe) is thought to be one of the key ingredients regulating galaxy formation, theoretically it is still unclear how the available energy couples to the interstellar medium and how galactic scale outflows are launched. We present a novel implementation of six sub-grid SN feedback schemes in the moving-mesh code AREPO, including injections of thermal and/or kinetic energy, two parametrizations of delayed cooling feedback and a `mechanical' feedback scheme that injects the correct amount of momentum depending on the relevant scale of the SN remnant resolved. All schemes make use of individually time-resolved SN events. Adopting isolated disc galaxy set-ups at different resolutions, with the highest resolution runs reasonably resolving the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SN, we aim to find a physically motivated scheme with as few tunable parameters as possible. As expected, simple injections of energy overcool at all but the highest resolution. Our delayed cooling schemes result in overstrong feedback, destroying the disc. The mechanical feedback scheme is efficient at suppressing star formation, agrees well with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and leads to converged star formation rates and galaxy morphologies with increasing resolution without fine-tuning any parameters. However, we find it difficult to produce outflows with high enough mass loading factors at all but the highest resolution, indicating either that we have oversimplified the evolution of unresolved SN remnants, require other stellar feedback processes to be included, and require a better star formation prescription or most likely some combination of these issues.},

	abstract = {We undertake a systematic analysis of the early ({\textless}0.5 Myr) evolution of clustering and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in turbulent fragmentation simulations. These large-scale simulations produce up to thousands of stars in clusters that can individually contain up to several hundred stars, and thus for the first time offer the opportunity for a statistical analysis of IMF variations and correlations between stellar properties and cluster richness. The typical evolutionary scenario involves star formation in relatively small-n clusters which then progressively merge; the first stars to form are seeds of massive stars and achieve a head start in mass acquisition. These massive seeds end up in the cores of clusters and a large fraction of new stars of lower mass is formed in the outer parts of the clusters. The resulting clusters are therefore mass segregated at an age of 0.5 Myr, although the signature of mass segregation is weakened during mergers. We find that the resulting IMF has a smaller exponent (α = 1.8-2.2) than the Salpeter value (α = 2.35). The IMFs in subclusters are truncated at masses only somewhat larger than the most massive stars (which depends on the richness of the cluster) and an universal upper mass limit of 150 Msolar is ruled out. We also find that the simulations show signs of the integrated galactic IMF effect proposed by Weidner \& Kroupa, where the frequency of massive stars is suppressed in the integrated IMF compared to the IMF in individual clusters. We identify clusters in the simulations through the use of a minimum spanning tree algorithm which is readily applied to observational data and which allows easy comparison between such survey data and the predictions of turbulent fragmentation models. In particular, we present quantitative predictions regarding properties such as cluster morphology, degree of mass segregation, upper slope of the IMF and the relation between cluster richness and maximum stellar mass.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

The characteristic stellar mass of order one solar mass may derive from the typical masses of the observed star forming clumps in molecular clouds, and the typical clump mass may in turn be determined mainly by the Jeans mass, as is true in many numerical simulations of cloud collapse and fragmentation. The Salpeter power law that approximates the IMF at higher masses is less well understood, but it may result from the effects of continuing gas accretion by the more massive forming stars together with the effects of interactions and mergers in dense forming stellar systems. The mass of the most massive star that forms in a cluster is observed to increase systematically with the mass of the cluster, and the most massive clusters may form stars that are massive enough to collapse completely to black holes.},

A simple algorithm, according to which a cluster is filled up with stars that are chosen randomly from the standard initial mass function (IMF) but sorted with increasing mass, yields an excellent description of the observational data. Algorithms based on random sampling from the IMF without sorted adding are ruled out with a confidence larger than 0.9999. A physical explanation of this would be that a cluster forms by more-massive stars being consecutively added until the resulting feedback energy suffices to revert cloud contraction and stops further star formation. This has important implications for composite populations. For example, 104 clusters of mass 102Msolar will not produce the same IMF as one cluster with a mass of 106Msolar. It also supports the notion that the integrated galaxial stellar IMF (IGIMF) should be steeper than the stellar IMF and that it should vary with the star formation rate of a galaxy.},

We describe in detail the implementation of all relevant thermal stellar feedback mechanisms, i.e. photoelectric, photoionization and H2 dissociation heating as well as pumping of molecular hydrogen by UV photons. All included radiative feedback processes are extensively tested. We also compare our module to dedicated photodissociation region (PDR) codes and find good agreement in our modelled hydrogen species once our radiative transfer solution reaches equilibrium.

However, despite its importance, its structure and evolution is still not fully understood. Observations reveal that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, consists of different chemical phases, and is characterized by complex structure on all resolvable spatial and temporal scales. Our current numerical and theoretical models describe it as a strongly coupled system that is far from equilibrium and where the different components are intricately linked together by complex feedback loops. Describing the interstellar medium is truly a multi-scale and multi-physics problem. In these lecture notes we introduce the microphysics necessary to better understand the interstellar medium.

	abstract = {Star formation is a complex multi-scale phenomenon that is of significant importance for astrophysics in general. Stars and star formation are key pillars in observational astronomy from local star forming regions in the Milky Way up to high-redshift galaxies. From a theoretical perspective, star formation and feedback processes (radiation, winds, and supernovae) play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the physical processes at work, both individually and of their interactions. In this review we will give an overview of the main processes that are important for the understanding of star formation. We start with an observationally motivated view on star formation from a global perspective and outline the general paradigm of the life-cycle of molecular clouds, in which star formation is the key process to close the cycle. After that we focus on the thermal and chemical aspects in star forming regions, discuss turbulence and magnetic fields as well as gravitational forces. Finally, we review the most important stellar feedback mechanisms.},

We perform N-body simulations of the evolution of star clusters in a static background potential before adjusting that potential to model gas expulsion. We investigate the impact of varying the rate at which the gas is removed, and the instant at which gas removal begins. Reducing the rate at which the gas is expelled results in an increase in cluster survival. Quantitatively, this dependence is approximately in agreement with previous studies, despite their use of smooth and virialized initial stellar distributions. However, the instant at which gas expulsion occurs is found to have a strong effect on cluster response to gas removal. We find if gas expulsion occurs prior to one crossing time, cluster response is poorly described by any global parameters. Furthermore, in real clusters the instant of gas expulsion is poorly constrained. Therefore, our results emphasize the highly stochastic and variable response of star clusters to gas expulsion.},

	abstract = {Context. The classic question of how young massive star clusters attain the shapes and sizes, as we find them today, is still a difficult one. Both observational and computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds suggest that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale (≲0.3 pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The present study investigates the possible ways in which a filament-like, compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can expand more than 10 times, still remaining massive enough (≳ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) to become the young massive star cluster that we observe today. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: To this end, model massive clusters (initially 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) are evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. Apart from the accurate calculation of two-body relaxation of the constituent stars, these evolutionary models take into account stellar-evolutionary mass loss and dynamical energy injection due to massive, tight primordial binaries and stellar-remnant black holes and neutron stars. These calculations also include a solar-neighbourhood-like external tidal field. All the computed clusters expand with time, and their sizes (effective radii) are compared with those observed for young massive clusters (≲ 100 Myr) in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In this study, it is found that beginning from the above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand on its own, I.e., due to two-body relaxation, stellar mass loss, and dynamical heating by primordial binaries and compact stars up to the observed sizes of young massive clusters; star clusters always remain much more compact than the observed ones. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: This calls for additional mechanisms that boost the expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion with ≈ 30\% star formation efficiency can indeed swell the newborn embedded cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their consequences are discussed.},

	abstract = {Most stars in the Galaxy are believed to be formed within star clusters from collapsing molecular clouds. However, the complete process of star formation, from the parent cloud to a gas-free star cluster, is still poorly understood. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud using the RAMSES-RT code. Stars are modelled using sink particles, from which we self-consistently follow the propagation of the ionizing radiation. We study how different feedback models affect the gas expulsion from the cloud and how they shape the final properties of the emerging star cluster. We find that the star formation efficiency is lower for stronger feedback models. Feedback also changes the high-mass end of the stellar mass function. Stronger feedback also allows the establishment of a lower density star cluster, which can maintain a virial or sub-virial state. In the absence of feedback, the star formation efficiency is very high, as well as the final stellar density. As a result, high-energy close encounters make the cluster evaporate quickly. Other indicators, such as mass segregation, statistics of multiple systems and escaping stars confirm this picture. Observations of young star clusters are in best agreement with our strong feedback simulation.},

We argue analytically that this type of mass distribution arises naturally in the relaxation from a hierarchically clustered distribution of stars into a monolithic star cluster through hierarchical merging. We show that initial profiles of finite maximum density will tend to produce successively shallower power-law profiles under hierarchical merging, owing to certain conservation constraints on the phase-space distribution. We perform N-body simulations of a pairwise merger of model star clusters and find that mergers readily produce the shallow surface brightness profiles observed in young massive clusters. Finally, we simulate the relaxation of a hierarchically clustered mass distribution constructed from an idealized fragmentation model. Assuming only power-law spatial and kinematic scaling relations, these numerical experiments are able to reproduce the surface density profiles of observed young massive star clusters. Thus, we bolster the physical motivation for the structure of young massive clusters within the paradigm of hierarchical star formation. This could have important implications for the structure and dynamics of nascent globular clusters.},

	abstract = {We investigate how star formation is spatially organized in the grand-design spiral NGC 1566 from deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey. Our contour-based clustering analysis reveals 890 distinct stellar conglomerations at various levels of significance. These star-forming complexes are organized in a hierarchical fashion with the larger congregations consisting of smaller structures, which themselves fragment into even smaller and more compact stellar groupings. Their size distribution, covering a wide range in length-scales, shows a power law as expected from scale-free processes. We explain this shape with a simple 'fragmentation and enrichment' model. The hierarchical morphology of the complexes is confirmed by their mass-size relation that can be represented by a power law with a fractional exponent, analogous to that determined for fractal molecular clouds. The surface stellar density distribution of the complexes shows a lognormal shape similar to that for supersonic non-gravitating turbulent gas. Between 50 and 65 per cent of the recently formed stars, as well as about 90 per cent of the young star clusters, are found inside the stellar complexes, located along the spiral arms. We find an age difference between young stars inside the complexes and those in their direct vicinity in the arms of at least 10 Myr. This time-scale may relate to the minimum time for stellar evaporation, although we cannot exclude the in situ formation of stars. As expected, star formation preferentially occurs in spiral arms.

Comparing the demographics of young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor clouds and YMCs across the Galaxy shows that gas in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density that molecular clouds already satisfy the criteria used to define YMCs, without forming stars. In this case formation can proceed in situ — i.e., the stars form at protostellar densities close to the final stellar density. Conversely, in the disk, the gas either begins forming stars while it is being accumulated to high density, in a "conveyor belt" mode, or the timescale to accumulate the gas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star-formation timescale. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two environments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally dependent density thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of similar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial protostellar densities. The fact that no strong, systematic variations in fundamental properties (such as the IMF) are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests that, statistically speaking, stellar mass assembly is not affected by the initial protostellar density. We then review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on three key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant (im)mortality, and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude that (1) the initial protostellar distribution is likely hierarchical, (2) YMCs likely experienced a formation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion, (3) YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age, and (4) YMCs have age spreads much smaller than their mean age. Finally, we show that it is plausible that metal-rich globular clusters may have formed in a similar way to YMCs in nearby galaxies. In summary, the study of YMC formation bridges star/planet formation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the local universe.},

The mechanism by which a molecular cloud fragments to form several hundred to thousands of individual stars has remained elusive. Here, we use a numerical simulation to follow the fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud, and the subsequent formation and early evolution of a stellar cluster containing more than 400 stars. We show that the stellar cluster forms through the hierarchical fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud. This leads to the formation of many small subclusters, which interact and merge to form the final stellar cluster. The hierarchical nature of the cluster formation has serious implications in terms of the properties of the new-born stars. The higher number-density of stars in subclusters, compared to a more uniform distribution arising from a monolithic formation, results in closer and more frequent dynamical interactions. Such close interactions can truncate circumstellar discs, harden existing binaries and potentially liberate a population of planets. We estimate that at least one-third of all stars, and most massive stars, suffer such disruptive interactions.},

	abstract = {We present a unified description of the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC). GHC constitutes a flow regime of (non-homologous) collapses within collapses, in which all scales accrete from their parent structures, and small, dense regions begin to contract at later times, but on shorter time-scales than large, diffuse ones. The different time-scales allow for most of the clouds' mass to be dispersed by the feedback from the first massive stars, maintaining the cloud-scale star formation rate low. Molecular clouds (MCs), clumps, and cores are not in equilibrium, but rather are either undergoing contraction or dispersal. The main features of GHC are as follows: (1) The gravitational contraction is initially very slow, and begins when the cloud still consists of mostly atomic gas. (2) Star-forming MCs are in an essentially pressureless regime, causing filamentary accretion flows from the cloud to the core scale to arise spontaneously. (3) Accreting objects have longer lifetimes than their own free-fall time, due to the continuous replenishment of material. (4) The clouds' total mass and its molecular and dense mass fractions increase over time. (5) The clouds' masses stop growing when feedback becomes important. (6) The first stars appear several megayears after global contraction began, and are of low mass; massive stars appear a few megayears later, in massive hubs. (7) The minimum fragment mass may well extend into the brown-dwarf regime. (8) Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton-like accretion occurs at both the protostellar and the core scales, accounting for an IMF with slope dN/dM ∝ M-2. (9) The extreme anisotropy of the filamentary network explains the difficulty in detecting large-scale infall signatures. (10) The balance between inertial and gravitationally driven motions in clumps evolves during the contraction, explaining the approach to apparent virial equilibrium, from supervirial states in low-column density clumps and from subvirial states in dense cores. (11) Prestellar cores adopt Bonnor-Ebert-like profiles, but are contracting ever since when they may appear to be unbound. (12) Stellar clusters develop radial age and mass segregation gradients. We also discuss the incompatibility between supersonic turbulence and the observed scalings in the molecular hierarchy. Since gravitationally formed filaments do not develop shocks at their axes, we suggest that a diagnostic for the GHC scenario should be the absence of strong shocks in them. Finally, we critically discuss some recent objections to the GHC mechanism.},

In our new algorithm, the internal motion of the star cluster is calculated accurately using the direct Hermite scheme with individual timesteps, and all other motions are calculated using the tree code with a second-order leapfrog integrator. The direct and tree schemes are combined using an extension of the mixed variable symplectic (MVS) scheme. Thus, the Hamiltonian corresponding to everything other than the internal motion of the star cluster is integrated with the leapfrog, which is symplectic. Using this algorithm, we performed fully self-consistent N-body simulations of star clusters in their parent galaxy. The internal and orbital evolutions of the star cluster agreed well with those obtained using the direct scheme. We also performed fully self-consistent N-body simulation for large-N models (N = 2 × 106).

	abstract = {Hierarchical code coupling strategies make it possible to combine the results of individual numerical solvers into a self-consistent symplectic solution. We explore the possibility of allowing such a coupling strategy to be non-intrusive. In that case, the underlying numerical implementation is not affected by the coupling itself, but its functionality is carried over in the interface. This method is efficient for solving the equations of motion for a self-gravitating system over a wide range of scales. We adopt a dedicated integrator for solving each particular part of the problem and combine the results to a self-consistent solution. In particular, we explore the possibilities of combining the evolution of one or more microscopic systems that are embedded in a macroscopic system. The here presented generalizations of BRIDGE include higher-order coupling strategies (from the classic 2nd order up to 10th-order), but we also demonstrate how multiple bridges can be nested and how additional processes can be introduced at the bridge time-step to enrich the physics, for example by incorporating dissipative processesor. Such augmentation allows for including additional processes in a classic Newtonian N-body integrator without alterations to the underlying code. These additional processes include for example the Yarkovsky effect, dynamical friction or relativistic dynamics. Some of these processes operate on all particles whereas others apply only to a subset. The presented method is non-intrusive in the sense that the underlying methods remain operational without changes to the code (apart from adding the get- and set-functions to enable the bridge operator). As a result, the fundamental integrators continue to operate with their internal time step and preserve their local optimizations and parallelism. Multiple bridges can be nested and coupled hierarchically, allowing for the construction of a complex environment of multiple nested augmented bridges. While the coupling topology may become rather complicated, we introduce the hierarchical coupling language (HCL), a meta language in which complex bridge topologies can be described. The meta language is meant for stimulating the discussion on even more complex hierarchies in which the bridge operators are introduced as patterns We present example applications for several of these cases and discuss the conditions under which these integrators can be applied. Typical applications range over 10 orders of magnitude in temporal and spatial scales when we apply the method to simulating planetary systems (au spatial and year-temporal scale) in a star cluster that orbits in the Galaxy (100 kpc-spatial and 10 Gyr-temporal scale).},

Using the STARFORGE simulations, it is possible to simulate this process in its entirety within a molecular cloud, while explicitly evolving the gas radiation and magnetic fields and following the formation of individual, low-mass stars. We find that individual star-formation sites merge to form ever larger structures, while still accreting gas. Thus clusters are assembled through a series of mergers. During the cluster assembly process, a small fraction of stars are ejected from their clusters; we find no significant difference between the mass distribution of the ejected stellar population and that of stars inside clusters. The star-formation sites that are the building blocks of clusters start out mass segregated with one or a few massive stars at their centre. As they merge the newly formed clusters maintain this feature, causing them to have mass-segregated substructures without themselves being centrally condensed. The merged clusters relax to a centrally condensed mass-segregated configuration through dynamical interactions between their members, but this process does not finish before feedback expels the remaining gas from the cluster. In the simulated runs, the gas-free clusters then become unbound and breakup. We find that turbulent driving and a periodic cloud geometry can significantly reduce clustering and prevent gas expulsion. Meanwhile, the initial surface density and level of turbulence have little qualitative effect on cluster evolution, despite the significantly different star formation histories.},

Star formation epochs in star clusters are generally set by gas flows that determine the abundance of gas in the cluster. We argue that there is likely only one star formation epoch after which clusters remain essentially clear of gas by cluster winds. Collisional dynamics is important in this phase leading to core collapse, expansion and eventual dispersion of every cluster. We review recent developments in the field with a focus on theoretical work.},

	abstract = {We discuss the mechanism of cluster formation in a numerical simulation of a molecular cloud (MC) undergoing global hierarchical collapse, focusing on how the gas motions in the parent cloud control the assembly of the cluster. The global collapse implies that the star formation rate (SFR) increases over time. The collapse is hierarchical because it consists of small-scale collapses within larger scale ones. The latter culminate a few Myr later than the first small-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete on to massive central clumps. The small-scale collapses consist of clumps that are embedded in the filaments and falling on to the large-scale collapse centres. The stars formed in the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps, so that the filaments feed both gas and stars to the massive central clump. This process leads to the presence of a few older stars in a region where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure, in which each unit is composed of smaller scale subunits that approach each other and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the infall motion of the gas on to the central clump, they tend to have larger velocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars formed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the initial mass function (IMF) simply as a probability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the local SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination with the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear late in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps. We discuss the correspondence of these features with observed properties of young stellar clusters, finding very good qualitative agreement.},

This approach allows scientists to use combinations of codes to solve highly coupled problems without the need to write new codes for other domains or significantly alter their existing codes. MUSE currently incorporates the domains of stellar dynamics, stellar evolution and stellar hydrodynamics for studying generalized stellar systems. We have now reached a "Noah's Ark" milestone, with (at least) two available numerical solvers for each domain. MUSE can treat multiscale and multiphysics systems in which the time- and size-scales are well separated, like simulating the evolution of planetary systems, small stellar associations, dense stellar clusters, galaxies and galactic nuclei. In this paper we describe three examples calculated using MUSE: the merger of two galaxies, the merger of two evolving stars, and a hybrid N-body simulation. In addition, we demonstrate an implementation of MUSE on a distributed computer which may also include special-purpose hardware, such as GRAPEs or GPUs, to accelerate computations.

The framework can be efficiently implemented and incurs an acceptable overhead. In practice, we measure the time spent in the framework to be less than 1\% of the wall-clock time. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating multiple modules addressing the same physics in different ways is relatively straightforward. Different modules may be advanced serially or in parallel. Despite initial concerns, we have encountered relatively few problems with this strict separation between modules, and the results of our simulations are consistent with earlier results using more traditional monolithic approaches.

	abstract = {The method of characteristics used for numerical computation of solutions of fluid dynamical equations is characterized by a large degree of non standardness and therefore is not suitable for automatic computation on electronic computing machines, especially for problems with a large number of shock waves and contact discontinuities. In 1950 v. Neumann and Richtmyer proposed to use, for the solution of fluid dynamics equations, difference equations into which viscosity was introduced artificially; this has the effect of smearing out the shock wave over several mesh points. Then, it was proposed to proceed with the computations across the shock waves in the ordinary manner. In 1954, Lax published the "triangle'' scheme suitable for computation across the shock" waves. A deficiency of this scheme is that it does not allow computation with arbitrarily fine time steps (as compared with the space steps divided by the sound speed) because it then transforms any initial data into linear functions. In addition, this scheme smears out contact discontinuities. The purpose of this paper is to choose a scheme which is in some sense best and which still allows computation across the shock waves. This choice is made for linear equations and then by analogy the scheme is applied to the general equations of fluid dynamics. Following this scheme we carried out a large number of computations on Soviet electronic computers. For a check, some of these computations were compared with the computations carried out by the method of characteristics. The agreement of results was fully satisfactory.},

	abstract = {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is developed based on the assumption that the normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate states for Bx ≠ 0, whereas the number of the intermediate states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained, the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system, and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in practical applications for the ideal MHD equations.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the regulation of galactic star formation rates ΣSFR in disk galaxies, in which interstellar medium (ISM) heating by stellar UV plays a key role. By requiring that thermal and (vertical) dynamical equilibrium are simultaneously satisfied within the diffuse gas, and that stars form at a rate proportional to the mass of the self-gravitating component, we obtain a prediction for ΣSFR as a function of the total gaseous surface density Σ and the midplane density of stars+dark matter ρsd. The physical basis of this relationship is that the thermal pressure in the diffuse ISM, which is proportional to the UV heating rate and therefore to ΣSFR, must adjust until it matches the midplane pressure value set by the vertical gravitational field. Our model applies to regions where Σ ≲ 100 Msun pc-2. In low-ΣSFR (outer-galaxy) regions where diffuse gas dominates, the theory predicts that ΣSFR ≈ Σ √ρsd. The decrease of thermal equilibrium pressure when ΣSFR is low implies, consistent with observations, that star formation can extend (with declining efficiency) to large radii in galaxies, rather than having a sharp cutoff at a fixed value of Σ. The main parameters entering our model are the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure in the diffuse ISM, the fraction of diffuse gas that is in the warm phase, and the star formation timescale in self-gravitating clouds; all of these are (at least in principle) direct observables. At low surface density, our model depends on the ratio of the mean midplane FUV intensity (or thermal pressure in the diffuse gas) to the star formation rate, which we set based on solar-neighborhood values. We compare our results to recent observations, showing good agreement overall for azimuthally averaged data in a set of spiral galaxies. For the large flocculent spiral galaxies NGC 7331 and NGC 5055, the correspondence between theory and observation is remarkably close.},

	abstract = {It remains a major challenge to derive a theory of cloud-scale (≲100 pc) star formation and feedback, describing how galaxies convert gas into stars as a function of the galactic environment. Progress has been hampered by a lack of robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifecycle. We address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for measuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and feedback to a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We measure the spatially resolved (∼100 pc) CO-to-H α flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between molecular gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the underlying evolutionary timeline. GMC lifetimes are short, typically 10-30 Myr, and exhibit environmental variation, between and within galaxies. At kpc-scale molecular gas surface densities Σ \_H\_2≥8 M\_⊙ pc{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}, the GMC lifetime correlates with time-scales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at Σ \_H\_2≤8 M\_⊙ pc{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and live for an internal dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without massive star formation traced by H α (75-90 per cent of the cloud lifetime), GMCs disperse within just 1-5 Myr once massive stars emerge. The dispersal is most likely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star formation efficiencies of 4-10 per cent. These results show that galactic star formation is governed by cloud-scale, environmentally dependent, dynamical processes driving rapid evolutionary cycling. GMCs and H II regions are the fundamental units undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations of 100-300 pc in star-forming discs. Future work should characterize the multiscale physics and mass flows driving these lifecycles.},

Here, we show that massive clusters are naturally produced in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of isolated 107M⊙ giant molecular clouds with properties typical of the local Universe, even under the influence of radiative feedback. In all cases, these massive clusters grow to globular cluster masses within 5 million years (Myr) via a roughly equal combination of filamentary gas accretion and mergers with less massive clusters. Lowering the heavy-element abundance of the molecular cloud by a factor of ten reduces the opacity of the gas and better represents the high-redshift Universe10,11. This results in higher gas accretion, leading to a mass increase of the largest cluster by a factor of around four. When combined with simulations of less massive molecular clouds12 (104-6M⊙), a clear relation emerges between the maximum cluster mass and the mass of the host cloud13. Our results indicate that young massive clusters—and potentially globular clusters—are simple power-law extensions of local cluster formation, and are insensitive to star formation thresholds.

	abstract = {We introduce the public version of the cosmological magnetohydrodynamical moving-mesh simulation code AREPO. This version contains a finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured, dynamic Voronoi tessellation coupled to a tree-particle-mesh algorithm for the Poisson equation either on a Newtonian or cosmologically expanding spacetime. Time integration is performed adopting local time step constraints for each cell individually, solving the fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. AREPO is a massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the message passing interface (MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical workload and memory balancing scheme to allow for optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The employed parallelization algorithms of AREPO are deterministic and produce binary-identical results when rerun on the same machine and with the same number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of galaxy formation. AREPO also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new scientific users.},

	shorttitle = {E pur si muove},
	abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code AREPO, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

One region is characterized by strongly converging flows, the other represents a more typical spiral arm region. We find that more massive clusters are able to form on shorter time-scales for the region with strongly converging flows. Mergers between clusters are frequent in the case of the strongly converging flows and enable the formation of massive clusters. We compare equivalent clusters formed in simulations with and without ionization. Photoionization does not prevent massive cluster formation, but can be seen to limit the masses of the clusters. On average, the mass is reduced by around 20 per cent, but we see a large spread from ionization having minimal difference to leading to a 50 per cent reduction in mass. Photoionization is also able to clear out the gas in the vicinity of the clusters on Myr time-scales, which can produce clusters with larger radii that are surrounded by more massive stellar haloes. We find that the ionizing feedback has more impact in our second region that is less dense and has less strongly converging flows.},

Using the recently developed 1D feedback scheme WARPFIELD to scan a large range of cloud and cluster properties, we show that an age offset of several million years between the stellar populations is in fact to be expected given the interplay between feedback and gravity in a giant molecular cloud with a density ≳500 cm-3 due to re-accretion of gas on to the older stellar population. Neither capture of field stars nor gas retention inside the cluster have to be invoked in order to explain the observed age offset in NGC 2070 as well as the structure of the interstellar medium around it.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we extend the unsplit staggered mesh scheme (USM) for 2D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [D. Lee, A.E. Deane, An unsplit staggered mesh scheme for multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 228 (2009) 952-975] to a full 3D MHD scheme. The scheme is a finite-volume Godunov method consisting of a constrained transport (CT) method and an efficient and accurate single-step, directionally unsplit multidimensional data reconstruction-evolution algorithm, which extends Colella's original 2D corner transport upwind (CTU) method [P. Colella, Multidimensional upwind methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 87 (1990) 446-466]. We present two types of data reconstruction-evolution algorithms for 3D: (1) a reduced CTU scheme and (2) a full CTU scheme. The reduced 3D CTU scheme is a variant of a simple 3D extension of Collela's 2D CTU method and is considered as a direct extension from the 2D USM scheme. The full 3D CTU scheme is our primary 3D solver which includes all multidimensional cross-derivative terms for stability. The latter method is logically analogous to the 3D unsplit CTU method by Saltzman [J. Saltzman, An unsplit 3D upwind method for hyperbolic conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 115 (1994) 153-168]. The major novelties in our algorithms are twofold. First, we extend the reduced CTU scheme to the full CTU scheme which is able to run with CFL numbers close to unity. Both methods utilize the transverse update technique developed in the 2D USM algorithm to account for transverse fluxes without solving intermediate Riemann problems, which in turn gives cost-effective 3D methods by reducing the total number of Riemann solves. The proposed algorithms are simple and efficient especially when including multidimensional MHD terms that maintain in-plane magnetic field dynamics. Second, we introduce a new CT scheme that makes use of proper upwind information in taking averages of electric fields. Our 3D USM schemes can be easily combined with various reconstruction methods (e.g., first-order Godunov, second-order MUSCL-Hancock, third-order PPM and fifth-order WENO), and a wide choice of 1D based Riemann solvers (e.g., local Lax-Friedrichs, HLLE, HLLC, HLLD, and Roe). The 3D USM-MHD solver is available in the University of Chicago Flash Center's official FLASH release.},

	abstract = {Massive stars influence their surroundings through radiation, winds, and supernova explosions far out of proportion to their small numbers. However, the physical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain poorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of molecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive star formation, we perform and analyze simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive, cloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing radiation using the FLASH adaptive-mesh refinement code. These simulations show fragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion flows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these flows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive star in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation. This explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order stellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of all masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead to a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would form without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation between the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star. It predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of collapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar mechanism will act during primordial star formation.},

	abstract = {Scattering encounters between binaries and single stars play a central role in determining the dynamical evolution of a star cluster. In addition, three-body scattering can give rise to many interesting exceptional objects: merging can produce blue stragglers; exchange can produce binaries containing millisecond pulsars in environments quite different from those in which the pulsars were spun up; various types of X-ray binaries can be formed, and their activity can be either shut off or triggered as a result of triple interactions. To date, all published results on three-body scattering have relied on human guidance for determining the correct parameter range for the envelope within which to perform Monte Carlo scattering experiments. In this paper we describe the first fully automatic determination of cross sections and reaction rates for binary-single-star scattering. Rather than relying on human inspection of pilot calculations, we have constructed a feedback system that ensures near-optimal coverage of parameter space while guaranteeing completeness. We illustrate our approach with a particular example, in which we describe the results of a three-body encounter between three main-sequence stars of different masses. We provide total cross sections, as well as branching ratios for the various different types of two-body mergers, three body mergers, and exchanges, both nonresonant and resonant. The companion paper in this series, Paper VII, provides a full survey of unequal-mass three-body scattering for hard binaries in the point-mass limit.},

We present a meta-algorithm' for choosing time steps in such a way as to guarantee time symmetry in any integration scheme, thus allowing vastly improved energy conservation for orbital calculations with variable time steps. We apply the algorithm to the familiar leapfrog scheme, and generalize to higher order integration schemes, showing how the stability properties of the fixed-step leapfrog scheme can be extended to higher order, variable-step integrators such as the Hermite method.

The eccentricity of primordial binaries allows a wide, non-interacting binary to survive the first and second supernovae in many more cases than suggested by previous calculations that assume circular orbits. Mass transfer in binaries enhances the rate of type I supernovae with respect to that of the type II supernovae. A sizable fraction of initial binaries merge into a single star; 10-15\% of the type II supernovae are from such mergers. Models in which neutron stars receive a kick velocity at birth predict birth rates for wide and close radio-pulsar binaries, and for high-mass (including Be-) X-ray binaries that are roughly in agreement with observations. All our models produce too many Her X-1 type binaries. The formation rate of radio-pulsars that remain in a binary after the first supernova explosion and are released at the second supernova event is predicted by our models to be comparable to the formation rate of recycled binary radio pulsars, i.e. less than a few per cent of the formation rate of single radio pulsars.},

	abstract = {We study the record of star formation activity within the dense cluster associated with the Orion Nebula. The bolometric luminosity function of 900 visible members is well matched by a simplified theoretical model for cluster formation. This model assumes that stars are produced at a constant rate and distributed according to the field-star initial mass function. Our best-fit age for the system, within this framework, is 2×106 yr. To undertake a more detailed analysis, we present a new set of theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks. These cover all masses from 0.1 to 6.0 Msolar, and start from a realistic stellar birthline. The tracks end along a zero-age main-sequence that is in excellent agreement with the empirical one. As a further aid to cluster studies, we offer an heuristic procedure for the correction of pre-main-sequence luminosities and ages to account for the effects of unresolved binary companions. The Orion Nebula stars fall neatly between our birthline and zero-age main-sequence in the H-R diagram. All those more massive than about 8 Msolar lie close to the main sequence, as also predicted by theory. After accounting for the finite sensitivity of the underlying observations, we confirm that the population between 0.4 and 6.0 Msolar roughly follows a standard initial mass function. We see no evidence for a turnover at lower masses. We next use our tracks to compile stellar ages, also between 0.4 and 6.0 Msolar. Our age histogram reveals that star formation began at a low level some 107 yr ago and has gradually accelerated to the present epoch. The period of most active formation is indeed confined to a few×106 yr, and has recently ended with gas dispersal from the Trapezium. We argue that the acceleration in stellar births, which extends over a wide range in mass, reflects the gravitational contraction of the parent cloud spawning this cluster.},

The accretion forces the cluster to contract, leading to the development of a high-density core with a maximum density 105 times the mean stellar density. This density is sufficient for a significant number of stellar collisions to occur, resulting in the most massive stars being formed through a combination of gas accretion and stellar mergers. In the simulation, 19 mergers occur, generally where a binary is forced to merge owing to the interaction with another star in a small-N group. These small-N groups form owing to the self-gravity of the gas and constitute the highest-density regions in the cluster. Binary formation in these groups is common, occurring through dynamical three-body capture. The massive stars are thus generally in binary systems, which can be relatively wide. The self-gravity of the gas also forms significant structure in the vicinity of the cluster core, while continuing infall forms a circumbinary disc around the most massive star. This structure may be the source of collimation for the observed outflows from young massive stars. Finally, the resultant initial mass function from the combination of gas accretion and stellar mergers is indistinguishable from a Salpeter mass function.},

This model circumvents the problem of accreting on to a star whose luminosity is sufficient to reverse the infall of gas. Instead, the central core of the cluster accretes from the surrounding gas, thereby decreasing its radius until collisions between individual components become sufficient. These components are, in general, intermediate-mass stars that have formed through accretion on to low-mass protostars. Once a sufficiently massive star has formed to expel the remaining gas, the cluster expands in accordance with this loss of mass, halting further collisions. This process implies a critical stellar density for the formation of massive stars, and a high rate of binaries formed by tidal capture.},

	abstract = {Star formation generally proceeds inside-out, with overdense regions inside protostellar cores collapsing rapidly, and progressively less dense regions following later. Consequently, a small protostar will form early in the evolution of a core, and collapsing material will fall to the protostellar surface and radiate away its gravitational potential energy. The resulting accretion luminosity will heat the core and may substantially affect the process of fragmentation. This is of particular interest for massive cores that, at their initial temperatures, have masses much greater than a thermal Jeans mass and thus might be expected to fragment into many stars during collapse. Here I show that accretion luminosity can heat the inner parts of a core to above 100 K very early in the star formation process, and that this in turn strongly suppresses fragmentation. This has implications for a number of outstanding problems in star formation, including the mechanism of massive star formation, the origin of the stellar initial mass function and its relationship to the core mass function, the demographics of massive binaries, and the equation of state in star-forming gas.},

	abstract = {Observations indicate that massive stars in the Galaxy form in regions of very high surface density, Σ{\textasciitilde}1 g cm-2. Clusters containing massive stars and globular clusters have a column density comparable to this. The total pressure in clouds of such a column density is P/k{\textasciitilde}108-109 K cm-3, far greater than that in the diffuse interstellar medium or the average in giant molecular clouds. Observations show that massive-star-forming regions are supersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of which individual massive stars form are as well. The protostellar accretion rate in such a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the star divided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star, as described by Stahler, Shu, \& Taam. The star formation time in this turbulent core model for massive-star formation is several times the mean free-fall time of the core out of which the star forms but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded. The high densities in regions of massive-star formation lead to typical timescales for the formation of a massive star of about 105 yr. The corresponding accretion rate is high enough to overcome the radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the star. For the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which the stars form have a density structure ρ{\textasciitilde}r-1.5, the protostellar accretion rate grows with time as m*{\textasciitilde}t. We present a new calculation of the evolution of the radius of a protostar and determine the protostellar accretion luminosity. At the high accretion rates that are typical in regions of massive-star formation, protostars join the main sequence at about 20 Msolar. We apply these results to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several observed hot molecular cores, including the Orion hot core and W3(H2O). In the appendices we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and argue that ``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.},

This competitive accretion naturally results in both initial mass segregation and a spectrum of stellar masses. Accretion in gas-dominated clusters is well modelled using a tidal-lobe radius instead of the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius. This works as both the stellar and gas velocities are under the influence of the same gravitational potential and are thus comparable. The low relative velocity which results means that RtidalBH in these systems. In contrast, when the stars dominate the potential and are virialized, RBHtidal and Bondi-Hoyle accretion is a better fit to the accretion rates.},

	abstract = {VFTS 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distance of 29 pc from the young massive cluster R136 in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud. It was previously reported as a candidate young stellar object, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN5h) star. Our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such as its intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of VFTS 682. To this purpose, we model optical spectra from the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey with the non-LTE stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energy distribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. We find the extinction properties to be highly peculiar (R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}V{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 4.7), and obtain a surprisingly high luminosity log (L/L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = 6.5 ± 0.2, corresponding to a present-day mass of {\textasciitilde}150 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The high effective temperature of 52.2 ± 2.5 kK might be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be the key process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. Lightcurves of the object show variability at the 10\% level on a timescale of years. Such changes are unprecedented for classical Wolf-Rayet stars, and are more reminiscent of Luminous Blue Variables. Finally, we discuss two possibilities for the origin of VFTS 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profound implications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) VFTS 682 is a slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster R136, which would make it the mostmassive runaway known to date. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope in programme 182.D-0222.},

Two main classes of massive star formation theory are under active study: core accretion and competitive accretion. In core accretion, the initial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores that condense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clump environment. They then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central disk to form a single star or a small-N multiple. In this case, the prestellar core mass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. In competitive accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn more chaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase of being in a massive, coherent core. In this case, massive star formation must proceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. If stellar densities become very high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also help to form the most massive stars. We review recent theoretical and observational progress toward understanding massive star formation, considering physical and chemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, and connections to star cluster formation.},

For collision, I discuss several mechanisms by which stars might be induced to collide, and I discuss what sorts of environments are required to enable each of these mechanisms to function. I then compare the direct accretion and collision scenarios, and discuss possible observational signatures that could be used to distinguish between them.

We predict that massive star-forming clumps, such as those observed in Motte et al., contract and grow in mass leading to the formation of massive stars. This occurs as mass is continually channelled from large radii on to the central protostars, which can become massive through accretion. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of massive star-forming clumps in a giant molecular cloud, we show that clumps are initially diffuse and filamentary, and become more concentrated as they collapse. Simulated interferometry observations of our data provide an explanation as to why young massive star-forming regions show more substructure than older ones. The most massive stars in our model are found within the most bound cluster. Most of the mass accreted by the massive stars was originally distributed throughout the clump at low densities and was later funnelled to the star due to global infall. Even with radiative feedback no massive pre-stellar cores are formed. The original cores are of intermediate mass and gain their additional mass in the protostellar stage. We also find that cores which form low-mass stars exist within the volume from which the high-mass stars accrete, but are largely unaffected by this process.},

	volume = {490},
	issn = {0035-8711},
	abstract = {We present a unified description of the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC). GHC constitutes a flow regime of (non-homologous) collapses within collapses, in which all scales accrete from their parent structures, and small, dense regions begin to contract at later times, but on shorter time-scales than large, diffuse ones. The different time-scales allow for most of the clouds' mass to be dispersed by the feedback from the first massive stars, maintaining the cloud-scale star formation rate low. Molecular clouds (MCs), clumps, and cores are not in equilibrium, but rather are either undergoing contraction or dispersal. The main features of GHC are as follows: (1) The gravitational contraction is initially very slow, and begins when the cloud still consists of mostly atomic gas. (2) Star-forming MCs are in an essentially pressureless regime, causing filamentary accretion flows from the cloud to the core scale to arise spontaneously. (3) Accreting objects have longer lifetimes than their own free-fall time, due to the continuous replenishment of material. (4) The clouds' total mass and its molecular and dense mass fractions increase over time. (5) The clouds' masses stop growing when feedback becomes important. (6) The first stars appear several megayears after global contraction began, and are of low mass; massive stars appear a few megayears later, in massive hubs. (7) The minimum fragment mass may well extend into the brown-dwarf regime. (8) Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton-like accretion occurs at both the protostellar and the core scales, accounting for an IMF with slope dN/dM ∝ M-2. (9) The extreme anisotropy of the filamentary network explains the difficulty in detecting large-scale infall signatures. (10) The balance between inertial and gravitationally driven motions in clumps evolves during the contraction, explaining the approach to apparent virial equilibrium, from supervirial states in low-column density clumps and from subvirial states in dense cores. (11) Prestellar cores adopt Bonnor-Ebert-like profiles, but are contracting ever since when they may appear to be unbound. (12) Stellar clusters develop radial age and mass segregation gradients. We also discuss the incompatibility between supersonic turbulence and the observed scalings in the molecular hierarchy. Since gravitationally formed filaments do not develop shocks at their axes, we suggest that a diagnostic for the GHC scenario should be the absence of strong shocks in them. Finally, we critically discuss some recent objections to the GHC mechanism.},

	abstract = {Star formation is inefficient. Only a few per cent of the available gas in molecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate (SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the SFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low temperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and collapse on their global mean freefall time-scale. And yet, they are observed to live about 10-100 times longer, i.e. the SFR per freefall time (SFRff) is only a few per cent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick global collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been proposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here, we run high-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time, if only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In contrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields and feedback are included step-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2-3 with each additional physical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFRff = 0.04, currently the closest match to observations, but still about a factor of 2-4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and with observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence producing large virial parameters, and including magnetic fields and feedback can produce realistic SFRs.},

We simulate the interaction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with three O-stars into a giant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 M⊙ of molecular material within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular clump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is entrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly resistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other dense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is gradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in excess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per cent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the difference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation begin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which the SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense material and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment. The molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6 Myr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per cent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a larger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more time is needed for it to be destroyed.},

	abstract = {Stellar winds contain enough energy to easily disrupt the parent cloud surrounding a nascent star cluster, and for this reason they have long been considered candidates for regulating star formation. However, direct observations suggest most wind power is lost, and Lancaster et al. recently proposed that this is due to efficient mixing and cooling processes. Here we simulate star formation with wind feedback in turbulent, self-gravitating clouds, extending our previous work. Our simulations cover clouds with an initial surface density of 102-104 M⊙ pc-2 and show that star formation and residual gas dispersal are complete within two to eight initial cloud freefall times. The "efficiently cooled" model for stellar wind bubble evolution predicts that enough energy is lost for the bubbles to become momentum-driven; we find that this is satisfied in our simulations. We also find that wind energy losses from turbulent, radiative mixing layers dominate losses by "cloud leakage" over the timescales relevant for star formation. We show that the net star formation efficiency (SFE) in our simulations can be explained by theories that apply wind momentum to disperse cloud gas, allowing for highly inhomogeneous internal cloud structure. For very dense clouds, the SFE is similar to those observed in extreme star-forming environments. Finally, we find that, while self-pollution by wind material is insignificant in cloud conditions with moderate density (only ≲10-4 of the stellar mass originated in winds), our simulations with conditions more typical of a super star cluster have star particles that form with as much as 1\% of their mass in wind material.},

Such clouds achieve a balance between the decay of turbulent energy and its regeneration in H II regions; summed over clouds, the implied ionizing luminosity and star formation rate are roughly consistent with the Galactic total. H II regions also photoevaporate their clouds: we derive cloud destruction times somewhat shorter than those estimated by Williams \& McKee. The upper mass limit for molecular clouds in the Milky Way may derive from the fact that larger clouds would destroy themselves in less than 1 crossing time. The conditions within starburst galaxies do not permit giant molecular clouds to be supported or destroyed by H II regions, and this may explain some aspects of the starburst phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Observed molecular clouds often appear to have very low star formation efficiencies and lifetimes an order of magnitude longer than their free-fall times. Their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed in them. We study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse by supersonic, gasdynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation. Computations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based, Lagrangian method (smoothed particle hydrodynamics [SPH]) and a grid-based, Eulerian, second-order method (ZEUS). The effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with this method. We find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapse can indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocks nevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and, presumably, stars. The occurrence and efficiency of local collapse decreases as the driving wavelength decreases and the driving strength increases. It appears that local collapse can be prevented entirely only with unrealistically short wavelength driving, but observed core formation rates can be reproduced with more realistic driving. At high collapse rates, cores are formed on short timescales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapse rates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibit considerable age spread. We suggest that this naturally explains the observed distinction between isolated and clustered star formation.},

	abstract = {The molecular component of the Galaxy is comprised of turbulent, magnetized clouds, many of which are self-gravitating and form stars. To develop an understanding of how these clouds' kinetic and structural evolution may depend on their level of turbulence, mean magnetization, and degree of self-gravity, we perform a survey of direct numerical MHD simulations in which three parameters are independently varied. Our simulations consist of solutions to the time-dependent MHD equations on a two-dimensional grid with periodic boundary conditions; an additional ``half'' dimension is also incorporated as dependent variables in the third Cartesian direction. Two of our survey parameters, the mean magnetization parameter β≡c2sound/v2Alfven and the Jeans number nJ≡Lcloud/LJeans, allow us to model clouds that either meet or fail conditions for magneto-Jeans stability and magnetic criticality. Our third survey parameter, the sonic Mach number M≡σvelocity/csound, allows us to initiate turbulence of either sub- or super-Alfvénic amplitude; we employ an isothermal equation of state throughout. We evaluate the times for each cloud model to become gravitationally bound and measure each model's kinetic energy loss over the fluid-flow crossing time. We compare the evolution of density and magnetic field structural morphology and quantify the differences in the density contrast generated by internal stresses for models of differing mean magnetization. We find that the values of β and nJ, but not the initial Mach number M, determine the time for cloud gravitational binding and collapse: for mean cloud density nH2=100 cm-3, unmagnetized models collapse after {\textasciitilde}5 Myr, and magnetically supercritical models generally collapse after 5-10 Myr (although the smallest magneto-Jeans stable clouds survive gravitational collapse until t{\textasciitilde}15 Myr), while magnetically subcritical clouds remain uncollapsed over the entire simulations; these cloud collapse times scale with the mean density as tg{\textasciitilde}n-1/2H2. We find, contrary to some previous expectations, less than a factor of 2 difference between turbulent decay times for models with varying magnetic field strength; the maximum decay time, for B{\textasciitilde}14 μG and nH2=100 cm-3, is 1.4 flow crossing times tcross=L/σvelocity (or 8 Myr for typical giant molecular cloud parameters). In all models we find turbulent amplification in the magnetic field strength up to at least the level βpert≡c2sound/δv2Alfven=0.1, with the turbulent magnetic energy between 25\% and 60\% of the turbulent kinetic energy after one flow crossing time. We find that for non-self-gravitating stages of evolution, when clouds have M=5-10, the mass-averaged density contrast magnitudes are in the range 0.2-0.5, with the contrast increasing both toward low and high β. Although our conclusions about density statistics may be affected by our isothermal assumption, we note that only the more strongly magnetized models appear to be consistent with estimates of clump/interclump density contrasts inferred in Galactic giant molecular clouds.},

	shorttitle = {Impact of relativistic jets on the star formation rate},
	abstract = {We apply a turbulence-regulated model of star formation to calculate the star formation rate (SFR) of dense star-forming clouds in simulations of jet-ISM interactions. The method isolates individual clumps and accounts for the impact of virial parameter and Mach number of the clumps on the star formation activity. This improves upon other estimates of the SFR in simulations of jet-ISM interactions, which are often solely based on local gas density, neglecting the impact of turbulence. We apply this framework to the results of a suite of jet-ISM interaction simulations to study how the jet regulates the SFR both globally and on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. We find that the jet strongly affects the multi-phase ISM in the galaxy, inducing turbulence and increasing the velocity dispersion within the clouds. This causes a global reduction in the SFR compared to a simulation without a jet. The shocks driven into clouds by the jet also compress the gas to higher densities, resulting in local enhancements of the SFR. However, the velocity dispersion in such clouds is also comparably high, which results in a lower SFR than would be observed in galaxies with similar gas mass surface densities and without powerful radio jets. We thus show that both local negative and positive jet feedback can occur in a single system during a single jet event, and that the star-formation rate in the ISM varies in a complicated manner that depends on the strength of the jet-ISM coupling and the jet break-out time-scale.},

	shorttitle = {Formation and evolution of young massive clusters in galaxy mergers},
	abstract = {Galaxy mergers are known to host abundant young massive cluster (YMC) populations, whose formation mechanism is still not well-understood. Here, we present a high-resolution galaxy merger simulation with explicit star formation and stellar feedback prescriptions to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the interstellar medium and YMCs. Compared with a controlled simulation of an isolated galaxy, the mass fraction of dense and high-pressure gas is much higher in mergers. Consequently, the mass function of both molecular clouds and YMCs becomes shallower and extends to higher masses. Moreover, cluster formation efficiency is significantly enhanced and correlates positively with the star formation rate surface density and gas pressure. We track the orbits of YMCs and investigate the time evolution of tidal fields during the course of the merger. At an early stage of the merger, the tidal field strength correlates positively with YMC mass, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tid\}{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.71\}\$, which systematically affects the shape of the mass function and age distribution of the YMCs. At later times, most YMCs closely follow the orbits of their host galaxies, gradually sinking into the center of the merger remnant due to dynamical friction, and are quickly dissolved via efficient tidal disruption. Interestingly, YMCs formed during the first passage, mostly in tidal tails and bridges, are distributed over a wide range of galactocentric radii, greatly increasing their survivability because of the much weaker tidal field in the outskirts of the merger system. These YMCs are promising candidates for globular clusters that survive to the present day.},

	title = {Control of star formation by supersonic turbulence},
	volume = {76},
	issn = {0034-6861},
	abstract = {Understanding the formation of stars in galaxies is central to much of modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the star formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar masses remains elusive. For several decades it has been thought that the star formation process is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and magnetostatic support, modulated by neutral-ion drift (known as ambipolar diffusion in astrophysics). Recently, however, both observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic turbulent flows rather than static magnetic fields control star formation. To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular before the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of the successes and problems of both the classical dynamical theory and the standard theory of magnetostatic support, from both observational and theoretical perspectives. The outline of a new theory relying on control by driven supersonic turbulence is then presented. Numerical models demonstrate that, although supersonic turbulence can provide global support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both local star formation and galactic-scale star formation. It suggests that individual star-forming cores are likely not quasistatic objects, but dynamically collapsing. Accretion onto these objects varies depending on the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree with observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent flow. Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming and dissolving in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else quickly collapsing into regions of violent star formation. Global star formation in galaxies appears to be controlled by the same balance between gravity and turbulence as small-scale star formation, although modulated by cooling and differential rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in star-forming regions of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while elsewhere coupling of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or gravity may be important.},

We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the regulation of galactic star formation rates ΣSFR in disk galaxies, in which interstellar medium (ISM) heating by stellar UV plays a key role. By requiring that thermal and (vertical) dynamical equilibrium are simultaneously satisfied within the diffuse gas, and that stars form at a rate proportional to the mass of the self-gravitating component, we obtain a prediction for ΣSFR as a function of the total gaseous surface density Σ and the midplane density of stars+dark matter ρsd. The physical basis of this relationship is that the thermal pressure in the diffuse ISM, which is proportional to the UV heating rate and therefore to ΣSFR, must adjust until it matches the midplane pressure value set by the vertical gravitational field. Our model applies to regions where Σ ≲ 100 Msun pc-2. In low-ΣSFR (outer-galaxy) regions where diffuse gas dominates, the theory predicts that ΣSFR ≈ Σ √ρsd. The decrease of thermal equilibrium pressure when ΣSFR is low implies, consistent with observations, that star formation can extend (with declining efficiency) to large radii in galaxies, rather than having a sharp cutoff at a fixed value of Σ. The main parameters entering our model are the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure in the diffuse ISM, the fraction of diffuse gas that is in the warm phase, and the star formation timescale in self-gravitating clouds; all of these are (at least in principle) direct observables. At low surface density, our model depends on the ratio of the mean midplane FUV intensity (or thermal pressure in the diffuse gas) to the star formation rate, which we set based on solar-neighborhood values. We compare our results to recent observations, showing good agreement overall for azimuthally averaged data in a set of spiral galaxies. For the large flocculent spiral galaxies NGC 7331 and NGC 5055, the correspondence between theory and observation is remarkably close.},

	abstract = {Modern extragalactic molecular gas surveys now reach the scales of star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs; 20-50 pc). Systematic variations in GMC properties with galaxy environment imply that clouds are not universally self-gravitating objects, decoupled from their surroundings. Here we re-examine the coupling of clouds to their environment and develop a model for 3D gas motions generated by forces arising with the galaxy gravitational potential defined by the background disk of stars and dark matter. We show that these motions can resemble or even exceed the motions needed to support gas against its own self-gravity throughout typical galactic disks. The importance of the galactic potential in spiral arms and galactic centers suggests that the response to self-gravity does not always dominate the motions of gas at GMC scales, with implications for observed gas kinematics, virial equilibrium, and cloud morphology. We describe how a uniform treatment of gas motions in the plane and in the vertical direction synthesizes the two main mechanisms proposed to regulate star formation: vertical pressure equilibrium and shear/Coriolis forces as parameterized by Toomre Q ≈ 1. As the modeled motions are coherent and continually driven by the external potential, they represent support for the gas that is distinct from that conventionally attributed to turbulence, which decays rapidly and thus requires maintenance, e.g., via feedback from star formation. Thus, our model suggests that the galaxy itself can impose an important limit on star formation, as we explore in a second paper in this series.},

We have removed that limitation by extending the sink particle capability to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for evaluating the disk viscosity parameter α due to the numerical viscosity of a hydrodynamics code and use it to compute α for our Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code.

	abstract = {We demonstrate with a new three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement code that perturbations arising from discretization of the equations of self-gravitational hydrodynamics can grow into fragments in multiple-grid simulations, a process we term ``artificial fragmentation.'' We present star formation calculations of isothermal collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In simulation of a Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied perturbations, we find artificial fragmentation can be avoided across the isothermal density regime by ensuring the ratio of cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans number, J ≡ ∆x/λJ , is kept below 0.25. We refer to the constraint that λJ be resolved as the Jeans condition. When an m = 2 perturbation is included, we again find it necessary to keep J {\textless}= 0.25 to achieve a converged morphology. Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without fragmentation of the filament, in agreement with the predictions of Inutsuka \& Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this singularity requires an arresting agent to slow the runaway density growth. Physically, the breakdown of isothermality due to the buildup of opacity acts as this agent, but many published calculations have instead used artificial viscosity for this purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution dependent, such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In the context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant violation of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the applied perturbation is removed from such a calculation, numerical fluctuations grow to produce substantial fragments not unlike those found when the perturbation is included. These findings indicate that calculations that employ artificial viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination by artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a necessary but not, in general, sufficient condition for convergence.},

	abstract = {Star formation is such a complex process that accurate numerical tools are needed to quantitatively examine the mass distribution and accretion of fragments in collapsing, turbulent, magnetized gas clouds. To enable a numerical treatment of this regime, we implemented sink particles in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code FLASH. Sink particles are created in regions of local gravitational collapse, and their trajectories and accretion can be followed over many dynamical times. We perform a series of tests including the time integration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a highly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu and show that the sink particle accretion rate is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately, we show that a very small time step is often required, for which we implemented subcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for sink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse. Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans instability, and converging flows are absolutely necessary for meaningful creation of sink particles. We apply our new sink particle module for FLASH to the formation of a stellar cluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink particles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties, indicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink particle formation times and positions. We find excellent agreement in the number of sink particles formed, and in their accretion and mass distributions.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new computational method for embedding Lagrangian sink particles into a Eulerian calculation. Simulations of gravitational collapse or accretion generally produce regions whose density greatly exceeds the mean density in the simulation. These dense regions require extremely small time steps to maintain numerical stability. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes approach this problem by introducing nongaseous, accreting sink particles, and Eulerian codes may introduce fixed sink cells. However, until now there has been no approach that allows Eulerian codes to follow accretion onto multiple, moving objects. We have removed that limitation by extending the sink particle capability to Eulerian hydrodynamics codes. We have tested this new method and found that it produces excellent agreement with analytic solutions. In analyzing our sink particle method, we present a method for evaluating the disk viscosity parameter α due to the numerical viscosity of a hydrodynamics code and use it to compute α for our Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code. We also present a simple application of this new method: studying the transition from Bondi to Bondi-Hoyle accretion that occurs when a shock hits a particle undergoing Bondi accretion.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate with a new three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement code that perturbations arising from discretization of the equations of self-gravitational hydrodynamics can grow into fragments in multiple-grid simulations, a process we term ``artificial fragmentation.'' We present star formation calculations of isothermal collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In simulation of a Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied perturbations, we find artificial fragmentation can be avoided across the isothermal density regime by ensuring the ratio of cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans number, J ≡ ∆x/λJ , is kept below 0.25. We refer to the constraint that λJ be resolved as the Jeans condition. When an m = 2 perturbation is included, we again find it necessary to keep J {\textless}= 0.25 to achieve a converged morphology. Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without fragmentation of the filament, in agreement with the predictions of Inutsuka \& Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this singularity requires an arresting agent to slow the runaway density growth. Physically, the breakdown of isothermality due to the buildup of opacity acts as this agent, but many published calculations have instead used artificial viscosity for this purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution dependent, such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In the context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant violation of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the applied perturbation is removed from such a calculation, numerical fluctuations grow to produce substantial fragments not unlike those found when the perturbation is included. These findings indicate that calculations that employ artificial viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination by artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a necessary but not, in general, sufficient condition for convergence.},

	abstract = {A method for following fragmentation simulations further in time using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented. In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time-steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted. The Boss \& Bodenheimer standard isothermal test case for the fragmentation of an interstellar cloud is used as an example for the technique. It is found that the binary protostellar system that forms initially does not merge, but instead forms a multiple system. The collapse is followed to four initial cloud free-fall times when approximately 80 per cent of the original mass of the cloud has been accreted by the protostars, or surrounds them in discs, and the remainder of the material has been expelled out to the radius of the initial cloud by the binary.},

	abstract = {In previous papers of this series, we developed a new algorithm for modelling the formation of star clusters in galaxy formation simulations. Here we investigate how dissolution of bound star clusters affects the shape of the cluster mass function and the metallicity distribution of surviving clusters. Cluster evolution includes the loss of stars that become unbound due to tidal disruption as well as mass-loss due to stellar evolution. We calculate the tidal tensor along cluster trajectories and use it to estimate the instantaneous mass-loss rate. The typical tidal tensor exhibits large variations on a time-scale of ∼100 Myr, with maximum eigenvalue of 107 Gyr-2, and median value of 104 Gyr-2 for the first Gyr after cluster formation. As a result of dynamical disruption, at the final available output of our simulations at redshift z ≈ 1.5, the cluster mass function has an approximately lognormal shape peaked at \{∼ \}10{\textasciicircum}\{4.3\} M\_\{☉\}. Extrapolation of the disruption to z = 0 results in too many low-mass clusters compared to the observed Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Over 70 per cent of GC candidates are completely disrupted before the present; only 10 per cent of the total GC candidate mass remains in surviving clusters. The total mass of surviving clusters at z = 0 varies from run to run in the range (2-6)× 10{\textasciicircum}7 M\_\{☉\}, consistent with the observed mass of GC systems in Milky Way-sized galaxies. The metallicity distributions of all massive star clusters and of the surviving GCs have similar shapes but different normalization because of cluster disruption. The model produces a larger fraction of very metal-poor clusters than observed. A robust prediction of the model is the age-metallicity relation, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically younger than metal-poor clusters by up to 3 Gyr.},

	abstract = {Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are able to reproduce numerous statistical properties of galaxies that are consistent with observational data. Yet, the adopted subgrid models strongly affect the simulation outcomes, limiting the predictive power of these simulations. In this work, we perform a suite of isolated galactic disc simulations under the SMUGGLE framework and investigate how different subgrid models affect the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We employ ASTRODENDRO, a hierarchical clump-finding algorithm, to identify GMCs in the simulations. We find that different choices of subgrid star formation efficiency, ɛff, and stellar feedback channels, yield dramatically different mass and spatial distributions for the GMC populations. Without feedback, the mass function of GMCs has a shallower power-law slope and extends to higher mass ranges compared to runs with feedback. Moreover, higher ɛff results in faster molecular gas consumption and steeper mass function slopes. Feedback also suppresses power in the two-point correlation function (TPCF) of the spatial distribution of GMCs. Specifically, radiative feedback strongly reduces the TPCF on scales below 0.2 kpc, while supernova feedback reduces power on scales above 0.2 kpc. Finally, runs with higher ɛff exhibit a higher TPCF than runs with lower ɛff, because the dense gas is depleted more efficiently, thereby facilitating the formation of well-structured supernova bubbles. We argue that comparing simulated and observed GMC populations can help better constrain subgrid models in the next generation of galaxy formation simulations.},

To study the effects of stellar feedback on the star formation efficiency of the clouds and the dynamical response of embedded star clusters, we perform a suite of isolated GMC simulations with star formation and momentum feedback subgrid models using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. The properties of our simulated GMCs span a wide range of initial mass, radius, and velocity configurations. We find that the ratio of the final stellar mass to the total cloud mass, ɛint, scales strongly with the initial cloud surface density and momentum feedback strength. This correlation is explained by an analytic model that considers force balancing between gravity and momentum feedback. For all simulated GMCs, the stellar density profiles are systematically steeper than that of the gas at the epochs of the peaks of star formation, suggesting a centrally concentrated stellar distribution. We also find that star clusters are always in a sub-virial state with a virial parameter ˜0.6 prior to gas expulsion. Both the sub-virial dynamical state and steeper stellar density profiles prevent clusters from dispersal during the gas removal phase of their evolution. The final cluster bound fraction is a continuously increasing function of ɛint. GMCs with star formation efficiency smaller than 0.5 are still able to form clusters with large bound fractions.},

	abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

We use the GIZMO code with the MFM mesh-free Lagrangian MHD method, augmented with new algorithms for gravity, time-stepping, sink particle formation and accretion, stellar dynamics, and feedback coupling. We survey a wide range of numerical parameters/prescriptions for sink formation and accretion and find very small variations in star formation history and the IMF (except for intentionally unphysical variations). Modules for mass-injecting feedback (winds, SNe, and jets) inject new gas elements on the fly, eliminating the lack of resolution in diffuse feedback cavities otherwise inherent in Lagrangian methods. The treatment of radiation uses GIZMO's radiative transfer solver to track five frequency bands (IR, optical, NUV, FUV, ionizing), coupling direct stellar emission and dust emission with gas heating and radiation pressure terms. We demonstrate accurate solutions for SNe, winds, and radiation in problems with known similarity solutions, and show that our jet module is robust to resolution and numerical details, and agrees well with previous AMR simulations.

On cloud scales, ionizing radiation creates H II regions, while stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) drive the ISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect of winds, radiation pressure, and SN explosions, and slowed down by gravity. Since radiative and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be taken into account in a self-consistent and combined manner, including the coupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic 1D feedback model for isolated massive clouds (≥105 M☉) to calculate shell dynamics and shell structure simultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical parameters (gas density, star formation efficiency, and metallicity) and to estimate escape fractions of ionizing radiation fesc, I, the minimum star formation efficiency ∊min required to drive an outflow, and recollapse time-scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback. Our results show that there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud dynamics, and that each feedback process significantly influences the efficiency of the others. We find that variations in natal cloud density can very easily explain differences between dense-bound and diffuse-open star clusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a 4-6 Myr age difference for massive clusters with multiple generations.},

We allow the clouds to form stars and study the dynamical effects of the ionizing radiation from the massive stars or clusters born within them. We find that dense filamentary structures and accretion flows limit the quantities of gas that can be ionized, particularly in the higher density clusters. More importantly, the higher escape velocities in our more massive (106 M☉) clouds prevent the H II regions from sweeping up and expelling significant quantities of gas, so that the most massive clouds are largely dynamically unaffected by ionizing feedback. However, feedback has a profound effect on the lower density 104 and 105 M☉ clouds in our study, creating vast evacuated bubbles and expelling tens of per cent of the neutral gas in the 3-Myr time-scale before the first supernovae are expected to detonate, resulting in clouds highly porous to both photons and supernova ejecta.},

The inhomogeneous structures of the model giant molecular clouds (GMCs) make them highly permeable to photons, ionized gas and supernova ejecta, and the leaking of ionized gas in particular strongly affects their evolution, reducing the effectiveness of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback is able to expel large fractions of the mass of the lower escape velocity clouds. Its impact on star formation is more modest, decreasing final star formation efficiencies by 10-20 per cent, and the rate of change of the star formation efficiency per freefall time by about one third.

	abstract = {We present a numerical study of the evolution of molecular clouds, from their formation by converging flows in the warm interstellar medium, to their destruction by the ionizing feedback of the massive stars they form. We improve with respect to our previous simulations by including a different stellar-particle formation algorithm, which allows them to have masses corresponding to single stars rather than to small clusters, and with a mass distribution following a near-Salpeter stellar initial mass function. We also employ a simplified radiative-transfer algorithm that allows the stellar particles to feedback on the medium at a rate that depends on their mass and the local density. Our results are as follows: (a) contrary to the results from our previous study, where all stellar particles injected energy at a rate corresponding to a star of ∼10 M☉, the dense gas is now completely evacuated from 10 pc regions around the stars within 10-20 Myr, suggesting that this feat is accomplished essentially by the most massive stars. (b) At the scale of the whole numerical simulations, the dense gas mass is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, although star formation (SF) never shuts off completely, indicating that the feedback terminates SF locally, but new SF events continue to occur elsewhere in the clouds. (c) The SF efficiency (SFE) is maintained globally at the ∼10 per cent level, although locally, the cloud with largest degree of focusing of its accretion flow reaches SFE ∼30 per cent. (d) The virial parameter of the clouds approaches unity before the stellar feedback begins to dominate the dynamics, becoming much larger once feedback dominates, suggesting that clouds become unbound as a consequence of the stellar feedback, rather than unboundness being the cause of a low SFE. (e) The erosion of the filaments that feed the star-forming clumps produces chains of isolated dense blobs reminiscent of those observed in the vicinity of the dark globule B68.},

	abstract = {We use two hydrodynamical simulations (with and without photoionizing feedback) of the self-consistent evolution of molecular clouds (MCs) undergoing global hierarchical collapse (GHC), to study the effect of the feedback on the structural and kinematic properties of the gas and the stellar clusters formed in the clouds. During this early stage, the evolution of the two simulations is very similar (implying that the feedback from low-mass stars does not affect the cloud-scale evolution significantly) and the star-forming region accretes faster than it can convert gas into stars, causing the instantaneous measured star formation efficiency (SFE) to remain low even in the absence of significant feedback. Afterwards, the ionizing feedback first destroys the filamentary supply to star-forming hubs and ultimately removes the gas from it, thus first reducing the star formation (SF) and finally halting it. The ionizing feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution of the forming stars because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars, which inherit its motion. In the non-feedback simulation, the groups remain highly compact and do not mix, while in the run with feedback, the gas dispersal causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion thus consists of the combined expansion of the groups. Most secondary star-forming sites around the main hub are also present in the non-feedback run, implying a primordial rather than triggered nature. We do find one example of a peripheral star-forming site that appears only in the feedback run, thus having a triggered origin. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the rule, although this may be an artefact of our simplified radiative transfer scheme.},

	abstract = {Star formation is an inefficient process and in general only a small fraction of the gas in a giant molecular cloud (GMC) is turned into stars. This is partly due to the negative effect of stellar feedback from young massive star clusters. Recently, we introduced a novel 1D numerical treatment of the effects of stellar feedback from young massive clusters on their natal clouds, which we named WARPFIELD. Here, we present version 2 of the WARPFIELD code, containing improved treatments of the thermal evolution of the gas and the fragmentation of the feedback-driven shell. As part of this update, we have produced new cooling and heating tables that account for the combined effects of photoionization and collisional ionization on the cooling rate, which we now make publicly available. We employ our updated version of WARPFIELD to investigate the impact of stellar feedback on GMCs with a broad range of masses and surface densities and a variety of density profiles. We show that the minimum star formation efficiency (SFE) ɛmin, i.e. the SFE above which the cloud is destroyed by feedback, is mainly set by the average cloud surface density. An SFE of 1-6 per cent is generally sufficient to destroy a GMC. We also find an SFE per free-fall time ɛff ∼ 0.3 per cent, in good agreement with recent observations. Our results imply that feedback alone is sufficient to explain the low observed SFE of GMCs. Finally, we show that very massive clouds with steep density profiles - possible proxies of the giant clumps observed in galaxies at z ≈ 2 - are more resilient to feedback than typical GMCs, with ɛmin between 1 and 12 per cent.},

	abstract = {Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their stellar offspring are the building blocks of galaxies. The physical characteristics of GMCs and their evolution are tightly connected to galaxy evolution. The macroscopic properties of the interstellar medium propagate into the properties of GMCs condensing out of it, with correlations between e.g. the galactic and GMC scale gas pressures, surface densities and volume densities. That way, the galactic environment sets the initial conditions for star formation within GMCs. After the onset of massive star formation, stellar feedback from e.g. photoionisation, stellar winds, and supernovae eventually contributes to dispersing the parent cloud, depositing energy, momentum and metals into the surrounding medium, thereby changing the properties of galaxies. This cycling of matter between gas and stars, governed by star formation and feedback, is therefore a major driver of galaxy evolution. Much of the recent debate has focused on the durations of the various evolutionary phases that constitute this cycle in galaxies, and what these can teach us about the physical mechanisms driving the cycle. We review results from observational, theoretical, and numerical work to build a dynamical picture of the evolutionary lifecycle of GMC evolution, star formation, and feedback in galaxies.},

A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation—turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity—are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica.

Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment?

These remain bound after gas removal. ▪ In the first ∼100 Myr after gas removal, clusters disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment. ▪ After ∼100 Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and shocks by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on ∼1–10-Gyr timescales. ▪ Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.

However, our binary fraction drops well below observed values for lower mass stars, presumably due to unincluded binary formation during initial star formation. Further, we observe a buildup of binaries near the hard-soft boundary that may be an important mechanism driving early cluster contraction.},

	abstract = {The fraction of stars in binary systems within star clusters is important for their evolution, but what proportion of binaries form by dynamical processes after initial stellar accretion remains unknown. In previous work, we showed that dynamical interactions alone produced too few low-mass binaries compared to observations. We therefore implement an initial population of binaries in the coupled magnetohydrodynamics and direct N-body star cluster formation code TORCH. We compare simulations with, and without, initial binary populations and follow the dynamical evolution of the binary population in both sets of simulations, finding that both dynamical formation and destruction of binaries take place. Even in the first few million years of star formation, we find that an initial population of binaries is needed at all masses to reproduce observed binary fractions for binaries with mass ratios above the q ≥ 0.1 detection limit. Our simulations also indicate that dynamical interactions in the presence of gas during cluster formation modify the initial distributions towards binaries with smaller primary masses, larger mass ratios, smaller semimajor axes and larger eccentricities. Systems formed dynamically do not have the same properties as the initial systems, and systems formed dynamically in the presence of an initial population of binaries differ from those formed in simulations with single stars only. Dynamical interactions during the earliest stages of star cluster formation are important for determining the properties of binary star systems.},

	title = {Effects of initial density profiles on massive star cluster formation in giant molecular clouds},
	volume = {502},
	issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
	abstract = {We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how initial density profiles of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) affect their subsequent evolution. We find that the star formation duration and integrated star formation efficiency of the whole clouds are not sensitive to the choice of different profiles but are mainly controlled by the interplay between gravitational collapse and stellar feedback. Despite this similarity, GMCs with different profiles show dramatically different modes of star formation. For shallower profiles, GMCs first fragment into many self-gravitation cores and form sub-clusters that distributed throughout the entire clouds. These sub-clusters are later assembled ``hierarchically'' to central clusters. In contrast, for steeper profiles, a massive cluster is quickly formed at the center of the cloud and then gradually grows its mass via gas accretion. Consequently, central clusters that emerged from clouds with shallower profiles are less massive and show less rotation than those with the steeper profiles. This is because 1) a significant fraction of mass and angular momentum in shallower profiles is stored in the orbital motion of the sub-clusters that are not able to merge into the central clusters 2) frequent hierarchical mergers in the shallower profiles lead to further losses of mass and angular momentum via violent relaxation and tidal disruption. Encouragingly, the degree of cluster rotations in steeper profiles is consistent with recent observations of young and intermediate-age clusters. We speculate that rotating globular clusters are likely formed via an ``accretion'' mode from centrally-concentrated clouds in the early Universe.},
